# Symfony bundle for prooph components

## Overview
This is a Symfony bundle for prooph components to get started out of the box with message bus, CQRS, event sourcing and 
snapshots with Doctrine.

It provides all service definitions and a default configuration. This is more like a Quick-Start bundle. If you want to
use the prooph components in production, we recommended to use only
[prooph-interop-bundle](https://github.com/proophsoftware/prooph-interop-bundle) and configure the prooph components for
your requirements.

**TODO: usage and service definitions**

## Installation

You can install prooph/prooph-bundle via composer by adding `"proophsoftware/prooph-bundle": "^0.1"` as requirement to your composer.json.
